I have already learnt some htmx and am using it to good effect.

This is a mini-project to improve my knowledge of learning on how to use it.

I'm working to the chapters as set out in the excellent https://hypermedia.systems/ and plan to structured this code into
branches that correspond well with the chapters there. 

Completed branches:
- web_1.0_application. This is the application in it pre-htmx state. 

I have been / am enjoying learning a few other things along the
way, including:
- Flask (this is the first time I've used it) 
- The css at https://missing.style/
- What raw html can do for you anyway!
- The flash functionality to flash a new message to the next request.
