I have already learnt some htmx and I'm using it to good effect.

This is a mini-project to improve my knowledge of learning on how to use it.

I'm working to the chapters as set out in the excellent https://hypermedia.systems/ and plan to structured this code into
branches that correspond well with the chapters there.

So far I'm still setting up the project to a pre-htmx state and have been enjoying learning a few other things along the
way, including:
- My first flask project. 
- the css at https://missing.style/
- what raw html can do for you anyway! 
- the flash function to flash a new message to the next request.
